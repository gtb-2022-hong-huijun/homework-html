### SEMANTIC HTML

- Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
- Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your website’s SEO.
- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` create the basic structure of the webpage.
- `<section>` defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
- `<article>` holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
- `<aside>` contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
- `<figure>` encapsulates all types of media.
- `<figcaption>` is used to describe the media in `<figure>`.
- `<video>`, `<embed>` and `<audio>` elements are used for media files.

#### Why use Semantic HTML?

- Accessibility: Semantic HTML makes web pages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.
- SEO: It improves the website SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are better able to identify the content of your website and weight the most important content appropriately. 
- Easy to Understand: Semantic HTML also makes the website’s source code easier to read for other web developers.
